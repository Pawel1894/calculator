# [Frontend Mentor - Calculator app challenge](https://three-theme-calculator.netlify.app/)

This is simple calculator app, but with 3 different themes. I tried to mimic windows 10 calculator behavior. Calculator is designed by [Fronted Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/calculator-app-9lteq5N29).

## Overview
  
### Motivation

My goal for creating this app was to learn [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) library. I think i managed to use as many [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) features as I could. I used ``` ThemeProvider ``` fully typed using TypeScript, Styled Component inheritance, custom props.
